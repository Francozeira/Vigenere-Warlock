The paper depicts the dilemmas raised by the implementation of the brazilian digital certificates’ system (brazil’s pki) and the process of informatization of its courts. The brazil’s pki was established by the national institute of information technology  (“instituto nacional de tecnologia da informação”, also know by its acronym “iti”) among a context of political turmoil along with a lot of criticism. The federal council of the bar association (“conselho federal da ordem dos advogados do brasil”) made especially harsh critics against the system. That was due to its interest in the defense on some corporative prerogatives, like the emission of lawyers ids. Also, it had been planning to launch its own digital certificates’ system. The conflict grew in many actions, including constitutional and ordinary lawsuits, without any visible solution. The paper describes the brazil pki system’s implementation process, and the main concepts of the technology. Then it analyses the legal framework and the critics delivered upon it. The paper was build from a research made with interviews and a survey inquiry about the models of managing digital certificates’ systems. Therefore, it concludes that both the technical and the legal debate show a social dispute, which has to be assessed from the comprehension of the technology’s social use. Hereafter, the lack of diffusion of a general use technology to guarantee data interchanges obviously delays the judicial system informatization.
